    "**Python** is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why to Learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is Interpreted** − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is Interactive** − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is Object-Oriented** − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python is a Beginner's Language** − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −\n",
    "\n",
    "* It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It supports automatic garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java."

    "“Data science” is just about as broad of a term as they come. It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data exploration & analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Included here: Pandas; NumPy; SciPy; a helping hand from Python’s Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "A pretty self-explanatory name. Taking data and turning it into something colorful.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Classical machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we could define this as any supervised or unsupervised learning task that is not deep learning (see below). Scikit-learn is far-and-away the go-to tool for implementing classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, while StatsModels is less actively developed but still has a number of useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Included here: Scikit-Learn, StatsModels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subset of machine learning that is seeing a renaissance, and is commonly implemented with Keras, among other libraries. It has seen monumental improvements over the last ~5 years, such as AlexNet in 2012, which was the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Included here: Keras, TensorFlow, and a whole host of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data storage and big data frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Big data is best defined as data that is either literally too large to reside on a single machine, or can’t be processed in the absence of a distributed environment. The Python bindings to Apache technologies play heavily here.\n",

    "* Apache Spark; Apache Hadoop; HDFS; Dask; h5py/pytables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, we sort the list by using the **sort** method of the list. It is important to understand that this method affects the list itself and does not return a modified list - this is different from the way strings work.
