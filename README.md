## About Myself
***

*My name is **Saif Siddiqui** and i am a B.E. graduate in in Information Technology. Since my graduatiom, i have been working in Course5 Intelligence as Data Analyst*

*I aspire to be a sucessful Data Scientist and i am highly motivated in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.*

## Motivation for this tutorial?

"I just need small advice...how to get a first data science job?"

"Can you please guide me...I am fresher looking for job opportunity"

"I am on my path to becoming a data scientist. I would appreciate it if you could help me in this path"

"I am software engineer at XXX and i want to become a data scientist, can you tell me what should i learn ?"

A lot of new graduates, my college juniors and other people who are trying to transform their career in to Data Science have been asking about the path they should follow and what things should they learn to start with.

When someone asks me how to get into data science, I ask them "which part?" It's comprised of many disciplines: data engineering, data mining, data analytics, data visualization and machine learning, to name a few.

Although there is not a single right path or a single course that will teach you everything about data science, i'll try my best to create and share a path that i followed in my 2 years(as of now) of experience. And if any course promises to teach you data science in some days or a week, do not expect too much from it instead of getting introduced to the terms in these courses).

# Day 1 - What is Data Science? 
***

We will first get introduced to:
<ul>
<li> What is Data Science? </li>
<li> Data Science Lifecyle </li>
<li> Application of Data Science </li> </ul>

## Plan of Attack 

I believe we have got a good amount of idea about what data science is and what is expected from a data scientist. 

Moving forward in the next 10 days, we will try to cover 2 core parts of data science i.e. firstly, we will learn statistics from the very beginning. Simultaneously, we will also be learning a programming language preferably Python (you can use the language you are comfortable in) and implement the learnings in python from scratch (without using inbuild libraries).
