    "Let's understand some of the advanced topics of SQL, before moving to other aspects of Databases and Data Mining/Warehousing aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints could be either on a column level or a table level. The column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas the table level constraints are applied to the whole table. We have already discussed these in our SQL Basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "* NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DEFAULT Constraint − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all values in a column are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* FOREIGN Key − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CHECK Constraint − The CHECK constraint ensures that all the values in a column satisfies certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* INDEX − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints can be specified when a table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement or you can use the ALTER TABLE statement to create constraints even after the table is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <img src='https://theartofpostgresql.com/img/SQL-JOINS-Example-0.png' height='300' width='600'> </img>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of joins available in SQL −\n",
    "\n",
    "**INNER JOIN** − returns rows when there is a match in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEFT JOIN** − returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RIGHT JOIN** − returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FULL JOIN** − returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELF JOIN** − is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CARTESIAN JOIN** − returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about joins in detail: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-set-1-inner-left-right-and-full-joins/\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNIONS CLAUSE\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have\n",
    "\n",
    "* The same number of columns selected\n",
    "* The same number of column expressions\n",
    "* The same data type and\n",
    "* Have them in the same order\n",
    "\n",
    "But they need not have to be in the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column1 [, column2 ]\n",
    "    FROM table1 [, table2 ]\n",
    "    [WHERE condition]\n",
    "\n",
    "    UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column1 [, column2 ]\n",
    "    FROM table1 [, table2 ]\n",
    "    [WHERE condition]\n",
    "    \n",
    "### NULL Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL NULL is the term used to represent a missing value. A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alias Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rename a table or a column temporarily by giving another name known as Alias. The use of table aliases is to rename a table in a specific SQL statement. The renaming is a temporary change and the actual table name does not change in the database. The column aliases are used to rename a table's columns for the purpose of a particular SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column1, column2....\n",
    "    FROM table_name AS alias_name\n",
    "    WHERE [condition];\n",

    "For Column:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column_name AS alias_name\n",
    "    FROM table_name\n",
    "    WHERE [condition];\n",

    "Example: To select ROLLNO as STUDENT_ROLLNO and NAME as STUDENT_NAME from our Students table\n",

    "\n",
    "1. SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://blog.couchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nosql-vs-sql-overview-1.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "* Analyzing behavioral related and customized sessions\n",

    "* Building custom dashboards\n",
